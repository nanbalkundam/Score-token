Score ERC20 TokenOverviewThe Score contract is a simple ERC20 token deployed on the Core Testnet, a blockchain test network designed for testing decentralized applications (dApps). Built using OpenZeppelin’s battle-tested libraries, the contract supports fungible token functionality with minting restricted to the contract owner. The token is named "score" with the symbol "sCORE" and is suitable for use cases like rewards, governance, or in-game currency in Web3 applications.This contract is ideal for developers building and testing dApps on Core Testnet. Tools like BlockOps simplify Core Testnet node setup and management, making deployment seamless for developers, including those in African Web3 communities.FeaturesERC20 Compliance: Implements the standard ERC20 interface for token transfers, approvals, and allowances.
Ownership: Uses OpenZeppelin’s Ownable to restrict minting to the contract owner.
Initial Minting: Mints 51,000,000,000,000,000 (51 * 10^15) tokens to the deployer upon initialization.
Custom Minting: Allows the owner to mint additional tokens to any address.

DeploymentThe Score contract has been deployed on the Core Testnet, a test network for Core Blockchain, ideal for developing and testing Web3 applications without using real funds. Use BlockOps to easily set up a Core Testnet node with a few clicks, streamlining the deployment process.Network: Core Testnet
