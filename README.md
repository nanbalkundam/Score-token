# 🏆 Score ERC20 Token

## Overview  
The **Score** contract is a simple **ERC20 token** deployed on the **Core Testnet**, a blockchain test network designed for testing decentralized applications (dApps).  

Built using **OpenZeppelin’s battle-tested libraries**, the contract supports fungible token functionality with **minting restricted to the contract owner**.  

- **Name:** `score`  
- **Symbol:** `sCORE`  
- **Use Cases:** Rewards, governance, in-game currency, and other Web3 applications.  

This contract is ideal for developers building and testing dApps on Core Testnet. Tools like **BlockOps** simplify Core Testnet node setup and management, making deployment seamless for developers, including those in African Web3 communities.
